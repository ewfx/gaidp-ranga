## 🎯 Introduction  
Automated Data Profiling for Regulatory Reporting is a system that uses **Generative AI (LLMs) and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques** to extract validation rules, detect anomalies, generate validation code, and provide flagged transactions with reasons. This helps financial institutions ensure compliance with federal regulations while reducing manual effort.

## 💡 Inspiration  
Regulatory compliance is a **critical challenge** in the financial sector, requiring **accurate and efficient data validation**. Manually profiling large datasets for anomalies and rule violations is time-consuming. This project **automates the process** using **AI-driven rule extraction** and **anomaly detection**, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## ⚙️ What It Does  
🔍 **Extracts validation rules** from financial data  
🚨 **Detects anomalies** in transactional records  
📝 **Generates validation code** automatically  
📊 **Flags suspicious transactions** with detailed reasoning  
📎 **Outputs results in a structured CSV format**  

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
- **Data Collection & Profiling**: Used sample **transaction datasets** to create validation rules  
- **Generative AI & LLMs**: Extracted regulatory rules and **automated validation logic generation**  
- **Unsupervised ML**: Identified **anomalies and suspicious patterns** in transactions  
- **Automation Pipeline**: Integrated **rule extraction, anomaly detection, and reporting**

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced  
⚠️ **Handling complex regulatory rules** and converting them into machine-readable formats  
📊 **Optimizing anomaly detection** without excessive false positives  
💾 **Processing large financial datasets** efficiently  
🛠️ **Ensuring model interpretability** for audit and compliance teams
